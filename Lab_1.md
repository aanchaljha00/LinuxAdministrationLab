# Introduction to Linux
## Overview
In this experiment, we explore the history and evolution of Linux, compare different Linux distributions, and examine Ubuntu along with its various derivatives.

## Description
### 1. History and Evolution of Linux
- Linux was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991 as a free and open-source operating system.
- Inspired by UNIX, Linux evolved with contributions from developers worldwide.
- Today, Linux powers **servers, mobile devices (Android), IoT devices, and supercomputers**.

### 2. Differences Between Linux Distributions
Linux distributions vary based on **package management, target users, and use cases**. The major categories include:

- **Debian-based (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint)**
  - Uses **APT** (Advanced Packaging Tool) for package management.
  - Stable and widely supported.
  
- **Red Hat-based (e.g., Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)**
  - Uses **YUM/DNF** for package management.
  - Preferred for enterprise and cloud computing.

- **Arch-based (e.g., Arch Linux, Manjaro)**
  - Uses **Pacman** as a package manager.
  - Rolling-release model for cutting-edge updates.

- **Other distributions (e.g., openSUSE, Solus, Gentoo)**
  - Unique architectures and package management systems.

### 3. Overview of Ubuntu and Its Derivatives
Ubuntu is a **Debian-based distribution** developed by **Canonical**. It offers several versions tailored for different use cases:

- **Ubuntu Desktop** – User-friendly interface for personal computers.
- **Ubuntu Server** – Optimized for cloud computing and enterprise environments.
- **Kubuntu** – Uses the **KDE Plasma** desktop environment.
- **Xubuntu** – Lightweight version with the **Xfce** desktop.
- **Lubuntu** – Minimalist version for low-end hardware.
- **Ubuntu Studio** – Designed for multimedia production.
